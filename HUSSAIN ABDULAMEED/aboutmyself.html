    <h1>About myself</h1>
   <p>My name is Abdulhamid, and I am currently a student at Crawford University, where I am pursuing a degree in Computer Science. <br> In my leisure time, I enjoy playing chess, which challenges my strategic thinking, and going on picnics, as they help me relax <br> and connect with nature.My favorite food is chicken and chips, a dish I always look forward to enjoying.</p>
