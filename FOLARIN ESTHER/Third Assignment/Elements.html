    <p   >Hello everyone, I have a very interesting gist for you all. 
     I would be glad if you would spare me a little of your time to 
     talk about my all-in-all,the one who showed me what real love means and peace.
     He found me in my darkest moment when I thought no one was there for me, but
     He came through for me in all ways.I dont deserve such love, but He did because 
     He is a loving Father. 
         My heavenly Father is the gist I have. I am not sorry if it sounds lame to you, 
     but I was once like that. When He opened my eyes, I was wowed. My all-in-all is 
     no one but Jesus Christ Himself, the master of change. He is the one who is slow 
     to anger and, at the same time, forgives when I realize my mistakes.</p>
